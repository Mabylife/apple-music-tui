RPC Documentation
Hostname and Port

All API endpoints are accessible at http://localhost:10767.

We've observed that using 127.0.0.1 when IPv4 is disabled tends to break and not connect. We recommend you do not turn off IPv4, but if you are required to do so, try using [::1]:10767.
Authentication

Unless explicitly disabled within Cider, all API requests require a valid API token. You can generate this token, or turn off authentication, from the menu at Settings -> Connectivity -> Manage External Application Access to Cider within Cider.

The generated token should be passed in the apitoken header of all requests. Do not prefix the token with Bearer or any other string; just pass the token by itself in the header.

This token is not required if disabled within the settings menu.
